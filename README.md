Overview:
This project implements a lightweight system monitoring and visualization tool that allows
you to view real-time information about your machine through a web interface.
The system combines:
• Bash scripts to collect raw system data
• Node.js to run those scripts safely
• A web interface to show the results clearly
• Docker to make the whole setup portable and easy to deploy
